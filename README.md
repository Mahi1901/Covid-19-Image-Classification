# Covid-19-Image-Classification
Given were training set and a test set of images of 3 classes. Each  image had a filename that is its unique id. The dataset comprised  of 3 classes: COVID-19, Viral Pneumonia, and Normal. The goal of  the project was to create a classifier capable of determining the  class of the X-ray image.

The project is inspired from a dataset from Kaggle.

The dataset (below 4 files) has to be downloaded from Olympus platform of Great Learning.
 testimage.npy
 testLabels.csv
 trainimage.npy
 trainLabels.csv

The context was to differentiate an X-ray image of a normal person from an unhealthy one and the ability to do so effectively meant better diagnosis.

Pre-processing of image data, visualization of images, building CNN and evaluation of the model were done.
